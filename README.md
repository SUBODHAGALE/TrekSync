## Introduction

The TrekSync project is a travel planning and tracking application that allows users to plan their trips, create itineraries, and record their travel experiences. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or just planning your first adventure, TrekSync provides a user-friendly platform to help you organize and document your journeys.

Key features of TrekSync include:

- **Trip Planning**: Create and manage your trips with ease. Add destinations, dates, and activities to your itinerary.

- **Travel Journal**: Keep a digital travel journal to record your experiences, upload photos, and write notes.

- **Collaboration**: Plan trips with friends and family by inviting them to join your trip and contribute to the itinerary.

- **Privacy**: Control the privacy settings of your trips and decide who can see your travel details.

- **Export and Share**: Export your trip data or share it on social media to inspire others.

This repository serves as the central hub for TrekSync's development, and we encourage contributions from the community to make TrekSync even better.
